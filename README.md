This project was created as a demo / template for R-based Shiny Apps for
students of Harvard's Spring 2021 iteration of Gov 1005 Big Data.

Key Features:

* Interactive Plot Demo

* Various methods of file linkage: local files, sourcing, and general file
organization

* Mapping example, including using `tidycensus` data within a publishable app

Note: The app runs locally and produces a vastly different set of outputs
than does the published version [link here](https://github.com/BeauMeche/Shiny_app_demo_1005)
