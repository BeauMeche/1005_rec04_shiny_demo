**This project was created as a demo / template for R-based Shiny Apps for
students of Harvard's Spring 2021 iteration of Gov 1005 Big Data.**

Key Features:

* Interactive Plot Demo

* Various methods of file linkage: local files, sourcing, and general file
organization

* Mapping example, including using `tidycensus` data within a publishable app

**Note:**

The app runs locally and produces a vastly different set of outputs than
does the published version [link here](https://github.com/BeauMeche/Shiny_app_demo_1005).

These differences were designed to emphasize the ways that the shape file issue,
described in the data cleaning section, causes a publication error and
subsequently how one might go about resolving the situation. I am not
proclaiming to be a shiny expert, only that I have found a few handy
workarounds. The intermediate steps shown to be erroneous for the poverty map
generally work for other, less problematic, samples of data
